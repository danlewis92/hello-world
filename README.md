Hey guys,

Dan here. What do you want to know?

Oh, a fun and unexpected fact? Well here goes...

I once signed up for a weekend's introduction to Skydiving. Went along, stayed 2 nights in a dusty dorm, and paid a
quite substantial amount for the training course. After the entire Saturday's training, we were all set to jump on the
Sunday. Only it was too windy! I never did get to Skydive, and I'd have to take the course all over again should I wish
to try again.
